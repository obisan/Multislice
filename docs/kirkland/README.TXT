                a few data files.

[2] macPPC: Executable programs for the Apple Macintosh Power-PC
            family of computers. These are in BinHex format to preserve
            the subtleties of the Mac files system. Each program needs to be
            decoded with the BinHex utility program (or equivalent).

              book (in the programming language C).  These should be machine
              independent (but there are NO guarantees) and can be compiled
              on a Mac, PC, or UNIX machine.
